# API Changelog

Here we list all changes affecting the mechanics of our public [API](/reference/api/), including new functionality and bug fixes, in reverse chronological order.

## 2015-05-20

* This is a test entry.
* Whenever the first API changes are pushed, this content should be modified to describe the actual changes.
* Also, please update the date sub-headline in the format `YYYY-MM-DD`.
* All changes during one day, even if deployed in multiple steps, should appear under the same date sub-headline.
