# The Giant Swarm API V1

The Giant Swarm API is a simple, mostly RESTful JSON based API, which can be accessed over an encrypted HTTPS connection. The API is used by the Giant Swarm `swarm` CLI command and should be incorporated into your software where programmatic control over your infrastructure is required.

*Note: The Giant Swarm API and this documentation is still in alpha and should be expected to change over time.*

<a name="basics"></a>
## The Basics
The following information is intended to familiarize you with the use of the Giant Swarm API. If you have a suggestion on how to improve the documentation or have found an error, [please open a ticket](https://github.com/giantswarm/docs-content/issues).

There are several types of management methods supported by the Giant Swarm API:

1. [Organization](#org)
1. [Application](#app)
1. [Service](#service)
1. [Component](#component)
1. [Instance](#instance)
1. [Connection](#connection)
1. [User](#user)

### Example Helper
For convenience, this page contains an <a id="link-helper" href="#helper">example helper</a> designed to replace variables used in examples on this page with ones that are valid for your account. The helper can be triggered by clicking on the link above, or hitting the `h` key while on this page. Please note the helper will not work when viewing this documentation on Github.

You may jump to the [password authentication](#passwordauth) section for information on retrieving an authentication token for use with the example helper.

<a name="naming"></a>
### Naming Conventions
This document uses brackets `< >` to identify variables such as organization and application names where they appear in JSON based requests. The remainder of the document uses braces `{ }` to identify variables where they appear outside JSON requests, such as in paths and request headers.

<a name="urls"></a>
### Resource URLs
All Giant Swarm API resources live under the following URL:

```bash
https://api.giantswarm.io/
```

The API is currently in Version 1.0, indicated by the `/v1/` path:

```bash
https://api.giantswarm.io/v1/
```

The `/org/`, `/env/` and `/app/` path parameters denote the concepts of organizations, environments and applications within the Giant Swarm service. These are respectively combined with their named objects within the system. 

Here is an example URL which refers to information about the organization named `bantinc`:

```bash
https://api.giantswarm.io/v1/org/bantic/
```

<a name="sdks"></a>
### SDKs
No public SDKs exist for the Giant Swarm API at this time, but we plan on adding them to this section when they become available. Please feel free to [comment on Discourse](http://discourse.giantswarm.io/t/sdks-for-the-giant-swarm-api/32) if you are interested in developing an SDK in your favorite language!

<a name="codes"></a>
### Response Codes
Giant Swarm's API returns the standard [HTTP status codes](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html). The API also uses a set of internal response codes which are returned with each request:

| Response Code | Response Type |
|-----|------|
| 10000 | STATUS_CODE_DATA |
| 10001 | STATUS_CODE_RESOURCE_UP |
| 10002 | STATUS_CODE_RESOURCE_DOWN |
| 10003 | STATUS_CODE_RESOURCE_CREATED |
| 10004 | STATUS_CODE_RESOURCE_STARTED |
| 10005 | STATUS_CODE_RESOURCE_STOPPED |
| 10006 | STATUS_CODE_RESOURCE_UPDATED |
| 10007 | STATUS_CODE_RESOURCE_DELETED |
| 10008 | STATUS_CODE_RESOURCE_NOT_FOUND |
| 10009 | STATUS_CODE_RESOURCE_ALREADY_EXISTS |
| 10010 | STATUS_CODE_RESOURCE_INVALID_CREDENTIALS |
| 10011 | STATUS_CODE_CONDITION_TRUE |
| 10012 | STATUS_CODE_CONDITION_FALSE |
| 10013 | STATUS_CODE_WRONG_INPUT |
| 10014 | STATUS_CODE_USER_ERROR |
| 10015 | STATUS_CODE_SERVER_ERROR |
| 10016 | STATUS_CODE_INVALID_VERSION_ERROR |

<a name="climethods"></a>
### Viewing API Methods via the CLI
The [Giant Swarm CLI](/reference/installation/) can be used with the `--debug` flag to show the methods it uses when it talks to the API.

Here is an example use of the CLI which lists all applications in the `bantic` organization's `dev` environment and then queries each one of them for its status:

```json
$ swarm --debug ls
DEBUG: GET https://api.giantswarm.io/v1/org/bantic/env/dev/app/
DEBUG: << 200 OK
DEBUG: GET https://api.giantswarm.io/v1/org/bantic/env/dev/app/currentweather/status
DEBUG: << 200 OK
1 application available in environment 'bant/dev':

application     created              status
currentweather  2015-04-28 17:28:36  up
```

In this example, we can see we should use a `GET` method on the `/v1/org/bantic/env/dev/app/` endpoint to get a list of applications in our `dev` environment.

<a name="processjson"></a>
### Processing Responses with bash
You may occasionally wish to prototype API calls in `bash`. Here's an example which uses the `jq` command to extract the required data from the JSON response data:

```json
curl -sS \
-H "Authorization: giantswarm e5239484-2299-41df-b901-d0568db7e3f9" \
https://api.giantswarm.io/v1/org/bantic/env/ | jq '.data.environments[0].name'

"dev"
```

*Note: If you are running on OSX, you may install the `jq` command by doing a `brew install jq`. You can find more information about `jq`, including install information for Linux, [on its website](http://stedolan.github.io/jq/)*.

<a name="auth"></a>
## Authentication
The Giant Swarm API requires authentication tokens for most of its URL endpoints. Tokens may be retrieved from the command line if the `swarm` client is [installed](/reference/cli/installation/) and [authenticated](/reference/cli/login/):

    $ cat ~/.swarm/token; echo;
    e5239484-2299-41df-b901-d0568db7e3f9

Authentication tokens may also be obtained by using the `/v1/user/{username}/login` endpoint while sending an encoded password via an `application/json` content type inside the `POST` request. 

<a name="passwordauth"></a>
### Password Authentication
To authenticate and get a token, call the `POST` method on the `/v1/user/{username}/login` method using a JSON object containing a `base64` encoded password. :

```json
curl -sS \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-X POST \
-d '{"password":"<base64_password>"}' \
https://api.giantswarm.io/v1/user/{username}/login
```

Here's an example which uses a bash partial using `echo` with the `-n` (no line feed) option to populate the password dynamically and uses Python to clean up the output:

```json
curl -sS \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-X POST \
--data '{"password":"'"$(echo -n f00bar | base64)"'"}' \
https://api.giantswarm.io/v1/user/bant/login \
| python -mjson.tool

{
    "data": {
        "Created": "2015-05-09 20:03:29.523713815 +0000 UTC",
        "Id": "e5239484-2299-41df-b901-d0568db7e3f9",
        "UserId": "31928724-522b-4941-bb6b-35286622ff65"
    },
    "status_code": 10000,
    "status_text": "success"
}
```

*Note: Be careful when using the `base64` command to generate encoded data from STDIN. For example, the default behavior of `echo foo | base64` in bash will result in a line feed `'/n'` being encoded in the password. Giant Swarm's API will not authorize a password with an appended line feed or carriage return.*

<a name="tokenauth"></a>
### Token Authentication
Tokens for use with API calls may be obtained by requesting the `/v1/user/{username}/login` endpoint, as shown above. The token is identified by the `Id` key in the response. In the example above, the token would be:

```text
e5239484-2299-41df-b901-d0568db7e3f9
```

This token must be passed in the headers of the API request. In this example `curl` request, we set the auth request header to `Authorization: giantswarm e5239484-2299-41df-b901-d0568db7e3f9`. Please note the string `giantswarm` is always required, and should not be substituted with another string.

Here's an example of using a token to `curl` the `/v1/org/bantic/env/` endpoint to list available environments:

```json
curl -sS \
-H "Authorization: giantswarm e5239484-2299-41df-b901-d0568db7e3f9" \
https://api.giantswarm.io/v1/org/bantic/env/ | python -mjson.tool

{
  "data": {
    "environments": [
      {
        "name": "dev"
      }
    ]
  },
  "status_code": 10000,
  "status_text": "success"
}
```

<a name="organization"></a>
## Organization Methods
The organization methods live under the `/v1/org/` endpoint. The following table lists the available methods for operating on organizations:

| Resource Path | Operation | Description |
|-----|-----|-----|
| /v1/org/\{org\}/env/ | [GET](#ListEnvironments) | Get the environments within the given organization that contain applications. |

### Execute a Remote Command on an Instance
To execute a command on a given instance, call the `POST` method on the `/v1/org/{org}/instance/{instance}/exec` endpoint:

```json
curl -sS \
-X POST \
-H "Authorization: giantswarm {token}" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
--data '{"cmd":["<command>"],"detach":true}' \
https://api.giantswarm.io/v1/org/bantic/instance/{instance}/exec
```
In addition to the path parameters above, the following parameters are used with the `exec` method:


##### Example with TEXT Response:
```json
curl -sS \
-X POST \
-H "Authorization: giantswarm e5239484-2299-41df-b901-d0568db7e3f9" \
-H "Content-Type: text/plain" \
-H "Connection: Upgrade" \
-H "Upgrade: tcp" \
--data '{"cmd":["ps","-ax"],"detach":false,"attach-stdout":true,"attach-stdin":true,"raw":true}' \
https://api.giantswarm.io/v1/org/bantic/instance/by3we1wr77b7/exec

  PID TTY      STAT   TIME COMMAND
    1 ?        Ss     0:00 sh -c echo "Hello from Giant Swarm. \o/" > index.html
    8 ?        S      0:02 python -m http.server
   92 ?        S+     0:00 /bin/sh
  130 ?        R+     0:00 ps -ax
```

#### Upgrading the Connection with Your Language of Choice
For full interactive `exec` mode, you must have set these HTTP header fields within your `POST`:

* `Content-Type: text/plain`
* `Connection: upgrade`
* `Upgrade: tcp`

You must also pass in the following parameters via JSON:

| Field Name | Field Type | Value Required for Streaming |
|-----|-----|-----|
| attach-stderr | bool | true |
| attach-stdin | bool | true |
| attach-stdout | bool | true |
| cmd | array | ["{command}",...] |
| detach | bool | false |
| raw | bool | true |
| tty | bool | true |

When the ```POST``` arrives, the server will do a normal HTTP response and then hijack the stream.  If the `detach` parameter is set to `true`, the server will return a normal status response and disconnect the session immediately.

In case of hijacking, the server will copy all bytes from the HTTP request into stdin (of the executed process) and multiplex stdout/stderr onto the HTTP response. This multiplexing uses the same protocol that is used by `docker exec`.

<a name="connection"></a>
## Connection Methods
The following method tests connections to the API. It will respond with OK when the API is up and essential infrastructure components are reachable. It will return FAILED if the API is up, but not all essential infrastructure components are reachable.

| Resource Path | Operation | Description |
|-----|-----|-----|
| /v1/ping | [GET](#Ping) | Ping Giant Swarm's API |

<a name="Ping"></a>
